<h2>What's the big idea?</h2>
<p>A simple one! Make a cross-platform, secure email system that can grow all by itself.</p>

<h2>How can it be done?</h2>
<p>To build such an application a number of open-source technologies are going to be combined, each with it's own purpose.</p>

      <td>Java</td>
      <td>Cross-platform, high level language which has access to a wide range of Cassandra APIs.</td>
    </tr>

      <td>TOR</td>
      <td>Obfuscates source/destination of the data and provides protection against network survailance.</td>

<p>The client of the email system will be built using Java SWING allowing for a cross-platform application. The client will connect to Cassandra using the <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/astyanax/wiki">Astyanax</a> API using TOR to protect the connection from survailance.</p>
