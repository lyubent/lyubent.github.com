    <h2>My chance to tell you about me!</h2>
    <p class="lead" style="text-align:justify;">
    Firstly I'm <string>a</strinke> the system developer at the university of 
    St-Andrews in Scotland, secondly a student at the university of Dundee. Big-data and
    distributed systems grabbed my interest two years ago during a university <a href='https://github.com/lyubent/JChrip'> project</a>
     focusing on creating a Twitter clone application. We had a choice of databases and cassandra was my primary choice. Why? Well, that's 
    the easiest question I'll ever answer. New technology is interesting, I love learning about it, and Cassandra does things differently.

    <h2>Cassandra for begginers? Awesome!</h2>
    <p class="lead" style="text-align:justify;">
    Getting started with Cassandra wasn't as easy as I would've liked it to be but learning the various APIs and dealing with errors made
    me a better developer. And if it wasn't for Cassandra, it would have taken me longer to 
    become an avid user of stackoverflow, my favourite website to this day.
